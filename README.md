# Sentiment word comparison
## Abstract
Sentiment words(positive or negative) are often a good indication of the intention of a text. Although the intention of a text can be nuanced or confusing at times. It is important to understand the intention of certain texts. This research analyzes the amount of sentiment words used between 2 texts from the Gutenberg database. Findings of this research aim to help development of current sentiment tools and better understand sentiment differences between specific genres.

## Background Infromation
Sentiment tools are already being developed to analyze texts on their overal sentimental value like Vader and LIWC for example:

## Research Question:
How does the frequency and distribution of positive and negative sentiment words differ between two texts of the same author?
## Hypothesis:
Non-fiction will contain fewer sentiment words overall compared to fiction, with a greater proportion of negative sentiment words in non-fiction.

## Method
To collect the desired data for this reasearch two books from the library of project gutenberg will be chosen. Preferably 2 books of different genres by the same author. To check for sentiment words in the texts a word list dataset by Prajwal Kanade from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwalkanade/sentiment-analysis-word-lists-dataset will be used. This dataset includes a list of positve words an d a list of negative sentiment words.
