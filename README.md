# Sentiment word comparison
## Abstract
Sentiment words, whether positive or negative, provide valuable insight into the underlying intention and emotional tone of a text. While the intention of a text can sometimes be nuanced or ambiguous, understanding it is essential for fields such as literary analysis, psychology, and computational linguistics. This research investigates the frequency and distribution of sentiment words across two texts from the Gutenberg database, focusing on differences between genres written by the same author. The findings aim to enhance the development of sentiment analysis tools and contribute to a deeper understanding of how genre influences sentiment expression in literature.

## Significance of the Research
Sentiment analysis plays a critical role in various domains, including natural language processing, market research, and behavioral studies. By examining sentiment differences across genres, this research can provide new insights into genre-specific emotional expression, enriching literary studies and improving the accuracy of sentiment tools. This study's findings could contribute to the refinement of existing sentiment analysis algorithms, enabling more precise assessments of texts from diverse contexts. Additionally, understanding sentiment trends in literature offers a foundation for examining broader cultural, social, and psychological patterns reflected in written works.

## Background Information
Sentiment analysis tools, such as VADER and LIWC, have been instrumental in assessing the emotional tone of texts. These tools use lexicons of sentiment-laden words and computational models to determine overall sentiment scores. For example:

- **VADER:** Hutto, C., & Gilbert, E. (2014). VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-Based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text. Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media, 8(1), 216-225. https://doi.org/10.1609/icwsm.v8i1.14550
- **LIWC:** Tausczik, Y. R., & Pennebaker, J. W. (2010). The psychological meaning of words: LIWC and computerized text analysis methods. Journal of Language and Social Psychology, 29(1), 24â€“54. https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X09351676

Despite their utility, sentiment analysis tools often struggle to account for contextual differences, such as those between literary genres. This research aims to address this gap by examining sentiment trends in texts written by the same author.

## Research Question:
How does the frequency and distribution of positive and negative sentiment words differ between two texts of the same author?
## Hypothesis:
Non-fiction will contain fewer sentiment words overall compared to fiction, with a greater proportion of negative sentiment words in non-fiction.

## Method
Two books of different genres by the same author will be selected from the Project Gutenberg library. These texts will undergo analysis using Prajwal Kanade's sentiment word list dataset, available at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwalkanade/sentiment-analysis-word-lists-dataset. The dataset provides categorized lists of positive and negative sentiment words, which will be used to evaluate the frequency and distribution of sentiment words in each text. This comparative approach will reveal genre-specific patterns in sentiment expression.
